## About this project

Looking for a new job position after over a decade at the same company can be a dauting experience. So many ads ask for different platforms / frameworks of which I have no real professional experience.

Now you can say that you are a fast learner, adapt quickly, all those buzzwords, but it is all they are really, buzzwords.

So, I set upon myself the task to build something using Laravel 7, a framework of which I had no knowledge before April 2020!

After watching the amazing Laracast videos on Laravel 6 and 7, I started developing a site with a simple backend to manage the structure and content, as well as a frontend to use as my online CV.

Here is the source code of what's done so far, so that prospect employers can also peruse through the code.

- [Online CV using this code](https://cv.oscarolim.com).
- [Video of the backend](https://laravel.com/docs/container). It's from an early build, the backend now has an extra block for embed video links and a few options on some blocks to adjust the rendering in the frontend.
